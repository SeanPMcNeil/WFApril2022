// // a library is a collection of code you don't need to write, you just have to let your computer know about it
// // JS has a built in Math library

// Math.ceil(9.51) //ceil is how you round numbers up, rounds everything up
// Math.floor(8.45) //floor rounds #s down, rounds everything down

// // We generally always round down in JS

// // Generating a random number

// var random = Math.random(); // returns the numbers between 0 and 1 -> [0:1) (inclusive of 0 up to, but not including 1)
// // using floor with random gives you an almost equal distrubutiuon of chances
// // using ceil with random means you will only get 0 is you roll exactly a 0

// random = random * 11; // gives between 0 and up to 11 (non-inclusive)
// random = Math.floor(random); // rounds down to only integers

// // for brevity

// for (var i = 0; i<10 ; i++){
//     var random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1); // 10 = range-1, 1 = minimum
//     console.log(random);
// }

// Dice Roller
// Using what we've learned about the Math library in JavaScript, complete the following function that should return a value between 1 through 6 at random.

function d6() {
    var roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6 + 1);
    return roll;
}
    
var playerRoll = d6();
console.log("The player rolled: " + playerRoll);
